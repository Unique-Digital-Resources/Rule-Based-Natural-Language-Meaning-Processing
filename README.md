# Rule-Based-Natural-Language-Meaning-Processing
A rule-based tool for processing and extracting meanings from natural language (Under development and research)
It is a deterministic Natural Language Meaning Processing library designed to extract precise, unambiguous meaning from text.

> **Philosophy**: Language is governed by rules, syntax, and logic. It is not a statistical distribution. This library processes language "the right way"—through structural parsing and logical transformation—rather than the probabilistic approximation used by LLMs.

## ⚠️ WARNING
**This project is currently under heavy research and development.**

## Objective
To transform natural language into a strict, programmatic data structure that computers can understand with 100% determinism.

### What it is:
*   **Rule-Based:** Relies on grammatical syntax and semantic logic, not neural weights.
*   **Structural:** Converts unstructured text into structured data.
*   **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the exact same output.

### What it is NOT:
*   Not a chatbot.
*   Not a text generator.
*   Not a probabilistic AI.

## Core Approach

1.  **Tokenization & Tagging:** Breaks text into semantic units based on linguistic rules.
2.  **Syntactic Parsing:** Builds a dependency tree based on grammatical structure (Subject, Predicate, Object).
3.  **Meaning Extraction:** Maps the tree to a predefined logical schema.
